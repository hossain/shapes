Chineese thinking game (tangram style)

There are 100 levels in this game which are intriguing. This game was created to bring competition for students in some high schools and to evaluate their creativity.

However the package works perfectly fine on Microsoft Windows (All versions), not to mention on Dos or any platform which runs DosBox.

The package includes DosBox 0.74 wrapper for windows to run the game.

To play the game on windows.
1. download pkg/Shapes1.win.zip
2. Extract it.

To compile the source code you need Turbo C++ 3.0

The game has been tested on DOS, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 10 and even Windows Mobile 6.

Enjoy.
