Released by GNU public license v3.

Chineese thinking game (tangram style)

I was developed many small DOS based games like Karate, Tennis, Dooz, Connect in high school but "Shapes GOLD" was my first professional game  for an Iranian Company.

This game was created for starting a competition by students in some schools. Nevertheless it wasn't for money. So I have full permission to release my own work to the public even if it's little late and DOS is obsolete.

However the package works perfectly fine on Microsoft Windows (All versions), not to mention on Dos or any platform which runs DosBox. I have even tested this game on my Xperia X1 (Windows Mobile 6).

The package includes DosBox 0.74 wrapper for windows to run the game.

To play the game on windows.
1. download pkg/Shapes1.win.zip
2. Extract it.
3. Run run.bat

To compile the source code you need Turbo C++ 3.0

The game has been tested on DOS, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 10.

Enjoy.
